Self-taught software engineer with 10 years of programming experience. Started out as a web developer but have transitioned to building software solutions and orchestrating architectures. Working mainly with Python, and am always independently learning new technologies. Passionate about security and the NBA :)

This blog is my way to share exciting insights I come up with, mainly about programming and security.
