**Python** is a beautiful language, and it contains many built-in modules that aim to help us write better, prettier code.

### Objective

Throughout this article, we will use some lesser-known modules and methods that I think can improve the way we code - both in visibillity and in efficiency.

### NamedTuple

I believe that some of you already know the more popular `namedtuple` from the `collections` module (if you don't - [check it out](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)), but since Python 3.6, a new class was added to the `typing` module: `NamedTuple`.

`NamedTuple` is actually a typed version of `NamedTuple`, and in my opinion, it is more readable:

```python
In [2]: import typing

In [3]: class BetterLookingArticle(typing.NamedTuple):
   ...:     title: str
   ...:     id: int
   ...:     description: str = "No description given."
   ...:

In [4]: BetterLookingArticle(title="Python is cool.", id=1)
BetterLookingArticle(title='Python is cool.', id=1, description='No description given.')
```

Here's the `namedtuple` version:

```python
In [6]: import collections

In [7]: Article = collections.namedtuple("Article", ["title", "description", "id"])

In [8]: Article(title="Python is cool.", id=1, description="")
Article(title='Python is cool.', description='', id=1)
```

Both classes are pretty similar and can save you and your fellow developers a lot of time trying to understand your code.

### array.array

> Efficient arrays of numeric values. Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained. - [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/array.html)

When using the `array` module, we need to instantiate it with a typecode, which is the type all of its elements will use. Let's compare time efficiency with a normal list, writing many integers to a file (using [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html) module for a regular list):

```python
In [9]: import array

In [10]: import pickle

In [11]: double_array = array.array("i", range(10 ** 6))
    ...: start_time = time.time()
    ...: with open("array_temp.bin", "wb") as f:
    ...:     double_array.tofile(f)
    ...: array_end_time = time.time() - start_time

In [12]: int_list = list(range(10 ** 6))
    ...: start_time = time.time()
    ...: with open("list_temp.bin", "wb") as f:
    ...:     pickle.dump(int_list, f)
    ...: list_end_time = time.time() - start_time

In [13]: print(f"It took {array_end_time} for int_array to complete")
    ...: print(f"It took {list_end_time} for int_list to complete")
It took 0.006399869918823242 for int_array to complete
It took 0.03600811958312988 for int_list to complete
In [14]: 0.03600811958312988 / 0.006399869918823242
Out[14]: 5.62638304213389
```

**5 times** faster. That's alot. Of course it also depends on the `pickle` module, but still - the array is way more compact than the list. So if you are using simple numeric values, you should consider using the `array` module.

### itertools.combinations

`itertools` is an impressive module. It has so many different time-saving methods, all of them are listed [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html). There's even a GitHub repository containing [More Itertools](https://github.com/erikrose/more-itertools)!

I got to use the `combinations` method this week and I thought I'd share it. This method takes an iterable and an integer as arguments, and creates a generator consisting of all possible combinations of the iterable with a maximum length of the integer given, without duplication:

```python
In [16]: import itertools

In [17]: list(itertools.combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2))
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
```

### dict.fromkeys

A quick and beatiful way of creating a dict with default values:

```python
In [18]: dict.fromkeys(["key1", "key2", "key3"], "DEFAULT_VALUE")
{'key1': 'DEFAULT_VALUE', 'key2': 'DEFAULT_VALUE', 'key3': 'DEFAULT_VALUE'}
```

### Last but not least - the `dis` module

> The [`dis`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis) module supports the analysis of CPython [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) by disassembling it.

As you may or may not know, Python compiles source code to a set of instructions called "bytecode". The `dis` module helps us handle these instructions, and it's a great debugging tool.

Here's an example from the [Fluent Python book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do):

```python
In [22]: t = (1, 2, [3, 4])
In [23]: t[2] += [30, 40]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-25-af836a8d44a2> in <module>
----> 1 t[2] += [30, 40]

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

In [24]: t
Out[24]: (1, 2, [3, 4, 30, 40])
```

We got an error - but the operation still succeeded. How come? Well, if we look at the bytecode (I added comments for the important parts):

```python
In [25]: dis.dis("t[a] += b")
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (t)
              2 LOAD_NAME                1 (a)
              4 DUP_TOP_TWO
              6 BINARY_SUBSCR
              8 LOAD_NAME                2 (b)
             10 INPLACE_ADD --> (value in t[a]) += b --> succeeds because list is mutable
             12 ROT_THREE
             14 STORE_SUBSCR --> Assign t[a] = our list --> Fails, t[a] is immutable.
             16 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE
```
